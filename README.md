# altinn-dev-extension
WebExtension to redirect Altinn 3 app-frontend to local development server

Clone the repo and add the folder to Chrome as an
[unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
This might not work on Firefox, as it is using Manifest v3.
